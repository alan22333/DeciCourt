> A blockchain-based decentralized judicial system that ensures fair and transparent judgments through smart contracts and jury voting mechanisms.

## üìñ Project Overview

DeciCourt is an innovative decentralized court system designed to solve trust issues in traditional judicial systems through blockchain technology. The system employs a jury voting mechanism combined with commit-reveal voting schemes to ensure fairness and transparency in the voting process.

### üåü Core Features

- **üîê Decentralized Governance**: Automated execution based on smart contracts
- **‚öñÔ∏è Jury Mechanism**: Stake tokens to become jurors and participate in case trials
- **üó≥Ô∏è Commit-Reveal Voting**: Prevents vote manipulation and ensures fairness
- **üí∞ Economic Incentives**: Reasonable reward and penalty mechanisms to encourage honest participation
- **üì± Modern Interface**: Intuitive user experience based on Neumorphism design
- **üîç Transparent & Traceable**: All operations recorded on blockchain, completely transparent
